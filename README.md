# DNA Splicing and Segment Identification

Designed and implemented an algorithm to efficiently identify segments of DNA and simulate the operation of inserting a segment into a given sequence, as well as identify genetic sequence across multiple strands.

## Task 1
1a and 1b implement different versions for identifying segments of DNA and performing "splicing", that is, inserting a sequence at a target location and index.

1a uses simple string operations provided by Python's library.

1b implements a Singly-linked-list approach the code for which can be found in LinkedList.py.

1bii goes further than just string comparison and uses a hashing function to speed up string search.

## Task 2
The purpose of the algorithms specified in (2) is to identify common sequences in gene strands.

2a implements an exponential (in time) solution whilst 2b has a polynomial complexity.

2d is the same as 2b but allows finding sequences across multiple strands.

## Tasks 1c and 2c
Those visualize the results and effectiveness of the different algorithms. (Requires *numpy* and *pyplot*).
